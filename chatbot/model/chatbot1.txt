Allergy : Allergies, also known as allergic diseases, are a number of conditions caused by hypersensitivity of the immune system to typically harmless substances in the environment; These diseases include hay fever, food allergies, atopic dermatitis, allergic asthma, and anaphylaxis; Symptoms may include red eyes, an itchy rash, sneezing, a runny nose, shortness of breath, or swelling; Food intolerances and food poisoning are separate conditions.

Gerd : Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), is a chronic condition in which stomach contents rise up into the esophagus, resulting in either symptoms or complications; Symptoms include the taste of acid in the back of the mouth, heartburn, bad breath, chest pain, regurgitation, breathing problems, and wearing away of the teeth; Complications include esophagitis, esophageal stricture, and Barrett's esophagus.

Peptic Ulcer Disease : Peptic ulcer disease (PUD) is a break in the inner lining of the stomach, the first part of the small intestine, or sometimes the lower esophagus; An ulcer in the stomach is called a gastric ulcer, while one in the first part of the intestines is a duodenal ulcer; The most common symptoms of a duodenal ulcer are waking at night with upper abdominal pain and upper abdominal pain that improves with eating; With a gastric ulcer, the pain may worsen with eating; The pain is often described as a burning or dull ache; Other symptoms include belching, vomiting, weight loss, or poor appetite; About a third of older people have no symptoms; Complications may include bleeding, perforation, and blockage of the stomach; Bleeding occurs in as many as 15% of cases.

Diabetes : Diabetes mellitus (DM), commonly known as diabetes, is a group of metabolic disorders characterized by a high blood sugar level over a prolonged period of time; Symptoms often include frequent urination, increased thirst and increased appetite; If left untreated, diabetes can cause many complications; Acute complications can include diabetic ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state, or death; Serious long-term complications include cardiovascular disease, stroke, chronic kidney disease, foot ulcers, damage to the nerves, damage to the eyes and cognitive impairment;

Diabetes is due to either the pancreas not producing enough insulin, or the cells of the body not responding properly to the insulin produced; There are three main types of diabetes mellitus:

Type 1 diabetes results from the pancreas's failure to produce enough insulin due to loss of beta cells; This form was previously referred to as "insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus" (IDDM) or "juvenile diabetes"; The loss of beta cells is caused by an autoimmune response; The cause of this autoimmune response is unknown;
Type 2 diabetes begins with insulin resistance, a condition in which cells fail to respond to insulin properly; As the disease progresses, a lack of insulin may also develop; This form was previously referred to as "non insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus" (NIDDM) or "adult-onset diabetes"; The most common cause is a combination of excessive body weight and insufficient exercise;
Gestational diabetes is the third main form, and occurs when pregnant women without a previous history of diabetes develop high blood sugar levels.

 
Gastroenteritis :  Gastroenteritis, also known as infectious diarrhea and gastro, is inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract—the stomach and intestine; Symptoms may include diarrhea, vomiting and abdominal pain; Fever, lack of energy and dehydration may also occur; This typically lasts less than two weeks; It is not related to influenza, though it has erroneously been called the "stomach flu".

Arthritis : Arthritis is a term often used to mean any disorder that affects joints; Symptoms generally include joint pain and stiffness; Other symptoms may include redness, warmth, swelling, and decreased range of motion of the affected joints; In some types of arthritis, other organs are also affected; Onset can be gradual or sudden.


Bronchial Asthma : Asthma is a long-term inflammatory disease of the airways of the lungs; It is characterized by variable and recurring symptoms, reversible airflow obstruction, and easily triggered bronchospasms; Symptoms include episodes of wheezing, coughing, chest tightness, and shortness of breath; These may occur a few times a day or a few times per week; Depending on the person, asthma symptoms may become worse at night or with exercise.

Hypertension : Hypertension (HTN or HT), also known as high blood pressure (HBP), is a long-term medical condition in which the blood pressure in the arteries is persistently elevated; High blood pressure typically does not cause symptoms; Long-term high blood pressure, however, is a major risk factor for coronary artery disease, stroke, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, peripheral arterial disease, vision loss, chronic kidney disease, and dementia;
High blood pressure is classified as primary (essential) hypertension or secondary hypertension; About 90–95% of cases are primary, defined as high blood pressure due to nonspecific lifestyle and genetic factors; Lifestyle factors that increase the risk include excess salt in the diet, excess body weight, smoking, and alcohol use; The remaining 5–10% of cases are categorized as secondary high blood pressure, defined as high blood pressure due to an identifiable cause, such as chronic kidney disease, narrowing of the kidney arteries, an endocrine disorder, or the use of birth control pills.


Migraine : Migraine is a primary headache disorder characterized by recurrent headaches that are moderate to severe; Typically, episodes affect one side of the head, are pulsating in nature, and last from a few hours to three days; Associated symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light, sound, or smell; The pain is generally made worse by physical activity, although regular exercise may have prophylactic effects; Up to one-third of people affected have aura: typically a short period of visual disturbance that signals that the headache will soon occur; Occasionally, aura can occur with little or no headache following it.
 
Cervical Spondylosis :  Spondylosis is the degeneration of the vertebral column from any cause; In the more narrow sense it refers to spinal osteoarthritis, the age-related wear and tear of the spinal column, which is the most common cause of spondylosis; The degenerative process in osteoarthritis chiefly affects the vertebral bodies, the neural foramina and the facet joints (facet syndrome); If severe, it may cause pressure on the spinal cord or nerve roots with subsequent sensory or motor disturbances, such as pain, paresthesia, imbalance, and muscle weakness in the limbs.

Jaundice :  Jaundice, also known as icterus, is a yellowish or greenish pigmentation of the skin and whites of the eyes due to high bilirubin levels; Jaundice in adults is typically a sign indicating the presence of underlying diseases involving abnormal heme metabolism, liver dysfunction, or biliary tract obstruction; The prevalence of jaundice in adults is rare, while jaundice in babies is common with an estimated 80% affected during their first week of life; The most commonly associated symptoms of jaundice are itchiness, pale feces, and dark urine.

Malaria : Malaria is a mosquito-borne infectious disease that affects humans and other animals; Malaria causes symptoms that typically include fever, tiredness, vomiting, and headaches; In severe cases, it can cause yellow skin, seizures, coma, or death; Symptoms usually begin ten to fifteen days after being bitten by an infected mosquito; If not properly treated, people may have recurrences of the disease months later; In those who have recently survived an infection, reinfection usually causes milder symptoms; This partial resistance disappears over months to years if the person has no continuing exposure to malaria.

Acne : Acne, also known as acne vulgaris, is a long-term skin condition that occurs when dead skin cells and oil from the skin clog hair follicles; Typical features of the condition include blackheads or whiteheads, pimples, oily skin, and possible scarring; It primarily affects skin with a relatively high number of oil glands, including the face, upper part of the chest, and back; The resulting appearance can lead to anxiety, reduced self-esteem, and, in extreme cases, depression or thoughts of suicide.


Chicken Pox: Chickenpox, also known as varicella, is a highly contagious disease caused by the initial infection with varicella zoster virus (VZV);The disease results in a characteristic skin rash that forms small, itchy blisters, which eventually scab over; It usually starts on the chest, back, and face; It then spreads to the rest of the body; Other symptoms may include fever, tiredness, and headaches; Symptoms usually last five to seven days; Complications may occasionally include pneumonia, inflammation of the brain, and bacterial skin infections; The disease is often more severe in adults than in children; Symptoms begin 10 to 21 days after exposure to the virus.

Dengue : Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne tropical disease caused by the dengue virus; Symptoms typically begin three to fourteen days after infection; These may include a high fever, headache, vomiting, muscle and joint pains, and a characteristic skin rash; Recovery generally takes two to seven days; In a small proportion of cases, the disease develops into severe dengue, also known as dengue hemorrhagic fever, resulting in bleeding, low levels of blood platelets and blood plasma leakage, or into dengue shock syndrome, where dangerously low blood pressure occurs.


Typhoid : Typhoid fever, also known simply as typhoid, is a bacterial infection due to a specific type of Salmonella that causes symptoms; Symptoms may vary from mild to severe, and usually begin 6 to 30 days after exposure; Often there is a gradual onset of a high fever over several days; This is commonly accompanied by weakness, abdominal pain, constipation, headaches, and mild vomiting; Some people develop a skin rash with rose colored spots; In severe cases, people may experience confusion; Without treatment, symptoms may last weeks or months; Diarrhea is uncommon; Other people may carry the bacterium without being affected, but they are still able to spread the disease to others; Typhoid fever is a type of enteric fever, along with paratyphoid fever.

Tuberculosis : Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease usually caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) bacteria; Tuberculosis generally affects the lungs, but can also affect other parts of the body; Most infections show no symptoms, in which case it is known as latent tuberculosis;  About 10% of latent infections progress to active disease which, if left untreated, kills about half of those affected; The classic symptoms of active TB are a chronic cough with blood-containing mucus, fever, night sweats, and weight loss; It was historically called consumption due to the weight loss; Infection of other organs can cause a wide range of symptoms.
Common Cold : The common cold, also known simply as a cold, is a viral infectious disease of the upper respiratory tract that primarily affects the respiratory mucosa of the nose, throat, sinuses, and larynx; Signs and symptoms may appear less than two days after exposure to the virus; These may include coughing, sore throat, runny nose, sneezing, headache, and fever;  People usually recover in seven to ten days, but some symptoms may last up to three weeks Occasionally, those with other health problems may develop pneumonia. 

Pneumonia : Pneumonia is an inflammatory condition of the lung primarily affecting the small air sacs known as alveoli; Symptoms typically include some combination of productive or dry cough, chest pain, fever and difficulty breathing; The severity of the condition is variable; Pneumonia is usually caused by infection with viruses or bacteria, and less commonly by other microorganisms; Identifying the responsible pathogen can be difficult; Diagnosis is often based on symptoms and physical examination; Chest X-rays, blood tests, and culture of the sputum may help confirm the diagnosis; The disease may be classified by where it was acquired, such as community- or hospital-acquired or healthcare-associated pneumonia.

Impetigo :  Impetigo is a bacterial infection that involves the superficial skin; The most common presentation is yellowish crusts on the face, arms, or legs; Less commonly there may be large blisters which affect the groin or armpits; The lesions may be painful or itchy; Fever is uncommon; It is typically due to either Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes; Risk factors include attending day care, crowding, poor nutrition, diabetes mellitus, contact sports, and breaks in the skin such as from mosquito bites, eczema, scabies, or herpes; With contact it can spread around or between people; Diagnosis is typically based on the symptoms and appearance.

Covid : The COVID-19 pandemic, also known as the coronavirus pandemic, is an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2);
Symptoms of COVID-19 are highly variable, ranging from none to life-threatening illness; The virus spreads mainly through the air when people are near each other; It leaves an infected person as they breathe, cough, sneeze, or speak and enters another person via their mouth, nose, or eyes; It may also spread via contaminated surfaces; People remain infectious for up to two weeks, and can spread the virus even if they do not show symptoms.


Coronaviruses are a group of related RNA viruses that cause diseases in mammals and birds; In humans and birds, they cause respiratory tract infections that can range from mild to lethal; Mild illnesses in humans include some cases of the common cold (which is also caused by other viruses, predominantly rhinoviruses), while more lethal varieties can cause SARS, MERS, and COVID-19; In cows and pigs they cause diarrhea, while in mice they cause hepatitis and encephalomyelitis.

Ebola, also known as Ebola virus disease (EVD) or Ebola hemorrhagic fever (EHF), is a viral hemorrhagic fever of humans and other primates caused by ebolaviruses; Signs and symptoms typically start between two days and three weeks after contracting the virus with a fever, sore throat, muscular pain, and headaches; Vomiting, diarrhoea and rash usually follow, along with decreased function of the liver and kidneys; At this time, some people begin to bleed both internally and externally; The disease has a high risk of death, killing 25% to 90% of those infected, with an average of about 50%; This is often due to low blood pressure from fluid loss, and typically follows six to 16 days after symptoms appear.

A vaccine is a biological preparation that provides active acquired immunity to a particular infectious disease; A vaccine typically contains a biological preparation from disease-causing microorganism, or since the beginning of the 21st century, made synthetically that resembles it; This preparation is often made from weakened or killed forms of the microbe, its toxins, or one of its surface proteins; The agent stimulates the body's immune system to recognize the agent as a threat and starts producing antibodies against it, so as to further recognize and destroy any of the microorganisms associated with that agent that it may encounter in the future; Vaccines can be prophylactic (to prevent or ameliorate the effects of a future infection by a natural or "wild" pathogen), or therapeutic (to fight a disease that has already occurred, such as cancer).
